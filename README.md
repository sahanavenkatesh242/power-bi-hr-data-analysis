# Crafting a Dynamic HR Data Dashboard for IT Company Operations.

### Project Overview 
The HR Data Dashboard project provides comprehensive insights into an IT company's workforce demographics, job satisfaction, job roles, and employee dynamics. The dashboard is built using Power BI and leverages two primary datasets: HR Data Analysis and HR Employee Data. These datasets were combined using a common identifier, "Employee ID," allowing for a thorough comparison and analysis of employee metrics.

#### The dashboard is structured into three main views:

1. Home: This section provides an overview of employee demographics, including total headcount, gender distribution, tenure distribution, active employee status, retirement eligibility, and the distribution of employees across different job levels. It also visualizes the commuting distances of employees from their homes to the workplace.

2. Action: This section focuses on severance benefits, highlighting employees who are eligible for severance pay. Eligibility is based on criteria such as tenure, promotion status, and potential retrenchment.

3. Details: This section delves deeper into specific departmental metrics, job satisfaction levels, overtime distribution, and the various job roles within the company. Job satisfaction is categorized into low, medium, and high using specific DAX formulas.

#### Key Insights
Demographics: The company has a total of 1,470 employees, with a gender distribution of 60% male and 40% female.

Promotion and Retention:

1. A small percentage (4.9%) of employees are due for promotion, while the vast majority (95.1%) are not.
2. A significant portion of the workforce (92%) is active, with 8% nearing retirement.
3. Employees with 3 to 4 years of service form the largest group within the company.

Distance and Job Levels:

1. Most employees live close to the workplace, with only a small percentage having a long commute.
2. Level 3 has the largest concentration of employees, indicating this might be a critical operational level within the organization.

Job Satisfaction:

1. A majority of employees report high job satisfaction, though a notable portion falls into the medium and low satisfaction categories.
2. Overtime is prevalent, with about 71.7% of employees working beyond regular hours.

Severance and Retirement:
The Action dashboard identifies 54 employees eligible for severance benefits, based on specific criteria such as tenure and retrenchment risk.

#### Recommendations
1. Promotion Opportunities: Given that a large majority of the workforce is not due for promotion, the company may benefit from reassessing its promotion cycles and criteria to ensure opportunities for advancement are well-distributed and accessible.

2. Employee Retention Strategies: With 8% of employees nearing retirement and a small percentage due for promotion, it's essential to develop strategies to retain experienced staff while also grooming new leaders from within.

3. Work-Life Balance: The high percentage of employees working overtime indicates a potential imbalance in work-life dynamics. Implementing measures to manage workloads and offering flexible working arrangements could help improve job satisfaction and reduce burnout.

4. Gender Diversity: With a 60:40 male-to-female ratio, there's an opportunity to explore initiatives that promote gender diversity and inclusion, especially in leadership roles.

5. Location and Commute: The majority of employees living close to the workplace suggest the company may be well-positioned in an urban area. However, for those with longer commutes, offering remote work options or flexible hours could enhance overall employee satisfaction.

6. Focus on Job Satisfaction: Regular assessments of job satisfaction and targeted interventions for those reporting medium or low satisfaction levels could help maintain high morale and productivity across the company.

#### Conclusion

This HR Data Dashboard provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the IT company's workforce, offering actionable insights that can help drive strategic decisions in HR management, employee retention, and operational efficiency. The visualizations created in Power BI ensure that complex data is presented in an accessible and meaningful way, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
